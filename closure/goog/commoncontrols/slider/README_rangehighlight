These are instructions for changing the active range highlight image in the
JFK two-thumb slider.

The image is kept as a SVG (vector image) to make it easier to update colors.
The process is:
1) Update SVG
2) Generate PNG
3) Compress PNG
4a) Put PNG into gstatic   <OR>
4b) Generate base64 encoding of PNG for use in CSS


First, edit the SVG file with the new colors and generate a PNG. Inkscape
will do fine (it's free, open-source, available on Linux/OSX/Windows).
If you happen to already have Illustrator and prefer that, it will work too.

Inkscape instructions:
1) Open the SVG file in Inkscape.
2) Press Ctrl+Shift+F to open the Fill and Stroke pane (you can also find it
    under the Object menu).
3) Click on the rectangle and change its fill to the desired background color.
4) Click on the lines and change their stroke to the desired line color.
    They're grouped, so they'll all change together.
5) Save the SVG, or Save As if it's a new independent theme.
6) Press Ctrl+Shift+E to open the Export Bitmap dialog (or find it under
    the File menu).
7) Click on the Page option, and make sure the width and height are
    what you expect.
8) Double-check the file name (it should be a png), then click Export.

To compress the png, run this command on the generated file
(see https://wiki.corp.google.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PngCrush for details):
  /home/build/google3/caribou/util/pngcrusher.sh myimage.png


For putting the PNG on gstatic:
- See http://goto.google.com/kennedyeng/technical-documentation/icon-repository
- The PNG is at google3/googledata/html/external_content/gstatic/ui/v1/slider/.
    Be sure to update the GSS file if you're using a different filename.


Or, to generate the base64 encoding of the PNG to use in a CSS data url:
  base64 --wrap=0 myimage.png
And copy the generated base64 string into the correct place in the GSS file:
  url(data:image/png;base64,_____);
